#SureDrive is an Insurance Management Portal that allows people with insurance policies to make premium payment and make claims as well.


#We implemented classes to make our code modular and easy to maintain.

#We used Bootstrap as our front end template. Bootstrap is easy to use and provides for beautiful interfaces that is easy to navigate.

#We also used MYSQL as our database. We used MYSQL because it is a relational database and enforces integrity making it appropriate for our web application.

#We used PHP for the backend. PHP is the most widely used language for backend and it is the language we are most comfortable with.

#The data structure we used was arrays which helped us to temporarily store retrieved items from the database so that we could access them by indexing.
